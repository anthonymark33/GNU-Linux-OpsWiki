The line log search tool (-L) shows the history of a function or line of code.

For example:

$ git log -L :myFunction:myFile.js

This will show all the changes made to myFunction in the file myFile.js as a series of patches.

Then git will attempt to work out the bounds of the function.

You can also give the tool a range of lines to search for.
