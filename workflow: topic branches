A topic branch is a branch that you create and use for one feature.

The idea is to work on a fix or an experiment separately from the master branch. This makes it easier to review changes, as all the commits relate to one topic.

For example, you could work on solving an issue:

$ git checkout -b iss14
# switch to new branch "iss14"
# fix the issue

Once you have solved the problem you can merge it into the master branch:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge iss14
# merge the fix

Then you can delete the topic branch:

$ git branch -d iss14
