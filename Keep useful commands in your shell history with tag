Tag commands for future reference:

$ some_command -x ~/ # useful

Then it is possible to search your bash history using Ctrl+R:

(reverse-i-search)`#useful': 
   some_command -x ~/ # useful

Because # useful is just a comment in bash you are not limited to this word. Therefore, creative use of tags can save you time.

Ensure ~/.bash_history is backed up to save the tag collection.
