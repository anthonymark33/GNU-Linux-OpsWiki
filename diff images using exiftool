ExifTool can extract the metadata (EXIF) from image files and convert it into text.

Add this to your .gitattributes file:

*.png diff=exif

Configure git to use exif:

$ git config diff.exif.textconv exiftool

If you run git diff you will see changes in the metadata between the images, for example in their file sizes:

-File Size                     : 40 kB
+File Size                     : 50 kB

Note that exiftool may not be present on your machine. You can install it with your system package manager.
