Use the built-in Node debugger by running your app in debug mode:

node debug [your app]

Place a debugger statement on the line of interest, for example:

for(var i=0; i<3; i++){
  debugger;
  console.log("hello " + i);
}
console.log("end");

Running this in the debugger will break at the relevant line.

Step through your code using these debug commands:

    continue – cont, c
    step – next, n
    step in – step, s
    step out – out, o
