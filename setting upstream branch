When you use the git clone or git checkout commands on a remote repository, a tracking branch is set up automatically.

Instead, you can explicitly set the upstream branch by using the -u or --set-upstream-to options.

For example, to set the current branch to track the remote branch scrollFix:

$ git branch -u origin/scrollFix
