The following git commands all have the same meaning: set up a branch sharefix to track the remote branch sharefix from origin, then switch to the new branch.

Full version:

$ git checkout -b sharefix origin/sharefix

--track shorthand:

$ git checkout --track origin/sharefix

Automatic:

$ git checkout sharefix

The final option works if the branch name you’re trying to checkout doesn’t exist locally and also matches a name on only one remote.
