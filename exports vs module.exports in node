Exporting a module in Node can be done in different ways. The most common is using the exports object:

//what is exported (other.js)
exports.say = function() {
    console.log('Hello from Enki!');
};
//how to import
var sample = require('./other.js');
sample.say(); // 'Hello from Enki!'

However, exports is just a helper for module.exports. The latter is ultimately returned by your module when called. exports only collects properties and attaches them to module.exports if and only if it doesn't have something on it already.

module.exports = 'Oops!';
exports.say = function() { 
  console.log('Hello from Enki!'); }

If we import it the same way as above, this will result in a TypeError because module.exports already had something in it. Export an array with module.exports:

module.exports = [ 'A', 'B', 'C'];

var sample = require('./other.js');
console.log(sample[2]); // 'C'
