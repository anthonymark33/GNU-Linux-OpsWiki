The package.json field accepts a field with the key config, you can map to it different custom parameters with the following syntax:

<name>[@<version>]:<key>

Note that version is purely optional.

These values can become useful as they can be accessed from within the .js files as environmental variables:

process.env.npm_package_config_<name>

For example, we can set a default port for our application:

//package.json
{ "name" : "enki",
  "config" : { 
    "port" : "8000"
    },
  //other params
}

The port can be accessed then from the .js file like this:

http.createServer(...).listen(
    process.env.npm_package_config_port);

The values can later be changed from within the command line:

$ npm config set enki:port 8080
// changes port value from 8000 to 8080
