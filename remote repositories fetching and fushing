If you are collaborating on a project stored in a remote repository, you will need to share and receive changes.

Fetching

git fetch gets all the data on the remote respository that you don't have yet and stores it in your local repository. It doesn't change what you're working on, you have to add the changes in manually with git merge.

To fetch from your remote repository origin:

$ git fetch origin

To fetch from all your remotes:

$ git fetch --all

Pushing

git push lets you share your changes with the rest of the team.

For example, to share your master branch with your origin repository:

$ git push origin master

Note: to be allowed to push you must have pulled the most recent version of the project and incorporated any changes into your code.
