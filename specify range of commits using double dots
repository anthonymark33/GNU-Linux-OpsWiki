The double dot syntax specifies all commits that you can reach from one branch but not another, i.e. unmerged commits.

For example to see the commits on test that are not on master:

$ git log master..test
de23f12 Add new game style
fe67de1 Edit game list

You can use this to see what you're going to push to a remote:

$ git log origin/master..HEAD

This will show the commits that are on your current branch but not on the remote.
