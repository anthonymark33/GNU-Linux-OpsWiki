A stack trace of all threads can be useful in diagnosing a number of issues such as deadlocks or hangs.

jstack is a utility that returns a complete dump of the various threads running in an app, which you can then be used to pinpoint the problem from the command line.

jstack works the same as pressing Ctrl-Break within the console window in which a Java program is running, or calling Thread.getAllStackTraces() or Thread.dumpStack() on each of the Thread objects in the VM.

Basic syntax:

$ jstack PID

Print a detailed dump:

$ jstack -l PID

A jstack call also dumps information about non-Java threads running within the VM, which aren't always available as Thread objects.
