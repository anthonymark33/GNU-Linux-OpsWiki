These three lines of CSS will select every element of the page and give them a slightly darker background color with the help of * selector.

* {
    background-color: rgba(0,255,0,0.1);
}

Elements inside other elements will get darker and darker.

This approach is useful when dealing with box models and when wanting to see how padding and margin affect each other.
