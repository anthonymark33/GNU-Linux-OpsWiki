jinfo prints configuration information for a given Java process or core file or a remote debug server. Configuration information includes Java System properties and Java virtual machine command line flags.

Previously available on other platforms, it was only included on Windows with the JDK 8 release.

Basic syntax:

$ jinfo PID

With the -flag option, jinfo can also dynamically set, unset, or change the value of certain Java VM flags for the specified Java process:

$ jinfo -flag ThreadStackSize PID

//output : -XX:ThreadStackSize=0

Print JavaSystem properties as name, value pairs:

$ jinfo -sysprops PID

If the given process is running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64 option:

$ jinfo -J-d64 -sysprops PID

The utility can also use the jsadebugd daemon to query a process or core file on a remote machine. Note that the output takes longer to print in this case.
