tcpdump is a useful utility to print out descriptions of contents of packets flowing through network interface card which match a given boolean expression.

sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -v 'tcp port 80'

The -i specifies the interface to listen on. The -v option specifies verbosity of packet information such as time to live, identification, total length and options in ip packet. The expression specifies a pcap-filter used to decide which packets to print. Here we listen for tcp traffic with either source or destination port set to 80.

See man pcap-filter for details on filters.
