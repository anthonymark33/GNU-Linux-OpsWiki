npm has great support for semanting versioning because it uses wildcards and expressions for versions of dependencies listed in the package.json file:

{  //other props
   "dependencies": {
      "module-a": "2.3.x",
      "module-b": "<=1.5.0"
  }
}

However, unexpected failure can occur when running npm install over time due to updated versions of your dependencies.

The command:

$ npm shrinkwrap

generates a snapshot of the current dependency tree and will lock down versions of dependencies.

This is done by automatically generating the npm-shrinkwrap.json file which will override dependency versioning of package.json.
