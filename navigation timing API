The Navigation Timing API provides timing information about the page load process. It also monitors how a user navigates to a page.
Timing metrics

The API records the time at key points in the page load process and stores each event as a property of the window.performance.timing object.

For example you can measure the total page load time experienced by the user:

window.addEventListener("load", function() {
  setTimeout(function() {
    var timing = window.performance.timing;
    var userTime = timing.loadEventEnd 
              - timing.navigationStart;
  }, 0);
}, false);

Navigation

The API also shows how a user navigated on a particular page. The type property can be 0 (URL, link etc), 1 (refreshed page), 2 (history) or 255 (other).

You can access this information by:

var navigation =
       window.performance.navigation;
var navType = navigation.type; 
var redirectCount = 
       navigation.redirectCount;
// number of redirects to current page
