To make things more simple and to save time, you can set up an alias for git commands that you use frequently. This means that you don't have to type out the whole command each time.

For example:

$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.cm commit

You can now just type git cm when you commit a file.

You can also create your own commands with aliases. A common example is to view your last commit:

$ git config --global 
      alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
$ git last
# details of last commit
