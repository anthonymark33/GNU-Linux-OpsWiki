Publishing packages to the npm registry is done via the npm publish command. The package will contain all the files in a specified folder that are not included in either .gitignore nor .npmignore files.

Sample publishing:

npm publish myFolder

Instead of the folder specified (which must include the package.json file) a tarball URL or file can be passed as argument.

Specifying tags for the version published is done via the --tag flag:

npm publish myFolder --tag=myTag

To install the version with myTag:

npm install myFolder@myTag

Premium npm users can publish private packages with --access tag:

npm publish myFolder --access=restricted

Note that once a package is published with a given name and version, the name/version combination cannot be used ever again even if the package is unpublished.
