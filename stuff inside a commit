When you make a commit, git stores a commit object.

You can view the information stored in the commit objects for that repository by using git log. For example:

$ git log
commit bc01a6
Author: C Mustard <cmustard@enki.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 25 09:41:11 2016 +0000
    changed content of README

The commit object contains a checksum, the author's name and email, the commit message, and a pointer to the commit that came before it (or multiple commits).
