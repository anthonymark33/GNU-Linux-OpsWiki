By default git log shows the whole commit history, with the most recent commit first.

You can limit this output to a specific time period by using --since/--after and --until/--before.

For example, to show commits in the past month:

$ git log --since="last month"

Many different formats are accepted, for example relative dates ("3 hours ago"), ISO 8601 and RFC 2822 formats, and "YYYY-MM-DD".
