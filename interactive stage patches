To partially stage a file:

$ git add -p
# or
$ git add --patch

Alternatively, when performing an interactive stage, you can type 5 (patch) in the interactive shell.

Once you have selected a file, git will display hunks of the file diff and ask:

Stage this hunk [y,n,a,d,/,j,J,g,e,?]? >

You can then choose yes y, no n and other options such as skipping a hunk.
