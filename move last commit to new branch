If you commit to the current branch when instead you wanted to commit to a new branch, you can easily correct your mistake.

For example if you made your commit to master instead of test:

$ git branch test
# create new branch from
# current HEAD
$ git reset --hard HEAD~ 
# reset master to before last commit
$ git checkout test
# continue on new branch
