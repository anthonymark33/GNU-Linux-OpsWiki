On modern browsers, building HTML strings with .join() is less efficient than the naive method.

Adding the values to an array and then joining them at the end:

var html = [];
for(var i=0; i<100; i++) {
  html.push('<p>', i, '</p>');
}
html = html.join(‘’);

Runs slower than building HTML strings using +=:

var html = '';
for(var i=0; i<100; i++) {
  html += '<p>' + i + '</p>'
}

This has been true since Firefox 1.0.
