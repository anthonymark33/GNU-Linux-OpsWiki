If you want to switch branches but aren't ready to commit the work on your current branch, you can stash the changes on the stack:

$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state
"WIP on master: bc43f10 Edit index.html"

Your working directory will now be clean and you can switch branches.

To view your stashes:

$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: bc43f10 
 Edit index.html
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c26ded3
 Add new game style

To apply a stash:

git stash apply stash@{1}

You don't have to apply the stash to the same branch you made it on. git will get you to merge any conflicts to apply it cleanly.

To remove a stash from the stack:

$ git stash drop stash@{0}

You can apply the stash and remove it from the list in one command:

$ git stash pop
