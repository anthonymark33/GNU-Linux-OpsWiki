If you want git to correct typos you can set help.autocorrect:

$ git config --global help.autocorrect 30

You set help.autocorrect to an integer representing the time you have to change your mind before git executes the command (1 = 0.1 seconds).

For example:

$ git comit
WARNING: You called a git command 
named 'comit', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that 
you meant 'commit'
in 3 seconds automatically...
