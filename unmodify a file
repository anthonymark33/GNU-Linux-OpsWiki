If you don't want to keep the changes that you've made to a file, you can use git checkout to revert to the previous version of the file.

For example:

$ git checkout -- MYFILE.md

It is not recommended that you use this command unless you are 100% certain. The deleted changes can't be recovered.

You can use stashing or branching to keep a copy of the changes to a file in case you need to access them at a later date.
