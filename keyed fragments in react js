With two sets of children that need reordering, there is no way of putting a key on each set without adding a wrapper element.

To solve this problem, React provides the createFragment add-on which can give keys to sets of children.

Array<ReactNode> createFragment(
    object children);

Instead of:

children = [this.props.rightChildren,
    this.props.leftChildren];

This can be done like:

var createFragment= require( 
    'react-addons-create-fragment`);

children = createFragment({
  right: this.props.rightChildren,
  left:this.props.leftChildren
});

The leftand right keys are used as keys for the entire set of children, and the rendering order is determined by the order of object's keys.

The return value of createFragment is an opaque object and React.Children helpers should be used in order to access it.

In the future, createFragment may be replaced by a different API which should allow you assigning keys without a wrapper.
