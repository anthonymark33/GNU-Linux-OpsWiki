You can use the option -s or --short to get a simplified status output.

For example:

$ git status --short
  M README
M   LICENSE
A   CONTRIBUTING
??  emoji.png

M means that the file has been modified. If the M letter is in the right hand column it has not been staged, if it is in the left hand column it has been.

?? means that a new file has been created and is not yet tracked.

A describes a new file that has been staged.
