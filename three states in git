In the basic git process, your file can be in one of three states: modified, staged or committed.

First you modify a file (e.g. hello.txt) in your working directory.

Then you stage the file, which adds a 'snapshot' of it to your staging area:

$ git add hello.txt

Finally you commit, which stores all the staged files in your git repository (a local database):

$ git commit -m 'Edit hello.txt'

This means the changes you made to hello.txt are now saved as a snapshot in the repository.
