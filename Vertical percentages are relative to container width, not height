Width percentage is intuitively calculated based on the width of the container.

However, percentages on properties like padding-top and margin-top are also calculated based on the width of the container, rather than the height.
```
div {
  height: 100px;
  width:  400px;
  padding-left: 10%; /* = 40px */ 
  padding-top: 50%;  /* = 200px */
}

```
