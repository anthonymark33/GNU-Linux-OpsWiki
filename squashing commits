If you contribute to an open source project, e.g. by submitting a pull request with a bug fix, it should be presented as one unit of code.

You should squash your commits together. For example, if you have three commits:

git reset HEAD~3
git add .
git commit -am "Fix bug #14"
git push --force

By doing this you can get rid of "fix typo" commits and have all your changes grouped in just one commit. This will keep the maintainer happy!
