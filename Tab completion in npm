Tab-completion can help you speed up typing commands in any command-line environments. You can also enable tab completion for npm commands as well as scripts defined in the package.json file.

$ npm completion >> tabCompletion.sh

This will create a .sh file that enables tab completion for the package.json file in the current directory. You need to load this file into the current shell.

Instead of creating a separate file, the tab completion script can be sent to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc files to enable tab completion for every new terminal window:

$ npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
