Git has a very flexible date format.

You can specify a date both in a fixed (01/01/16) and relative format ("last week").

Git can handle every division of time between seconds and years, timezones and most date formats. It can even make a best guess if you give it something it doesn't recognise!

Date examples

To see the commits since the 1st Jan 2016:

$ git log --since="01/01/2016"

To compare the repository between two different dates:

$ git diff master@{"yesterday"} 
  master@{"2 weeks 2 days ago"}

To revert to an old version of a repository:

$ git revert master@{"last Tuesday"}

Note: these commands use the committer date not the author date. The committer date refers to the time the work was last applied.
