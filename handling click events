JavaScript provides a way to handle different click events such as right clicks and double clicks.

Keep in mind that click events will also trigger some mouse events.

Click events supported in JavaScript:

    click : mousedown and mouseup events are also triggered before
    contextmenu : it's preceded by mousedown and succeded by mouseup
    dbclick : triggers two complete clicks before the double.

The order is consistent across all browsers except IE<9 which skips second click on dbclick.

Add a listener to these events:

myVar.addEventListener('click', 
myClickFunction, false);
myVar.addEventListener('dbclick', 
myDoubleClickFunction, false);

To handle both single clicks and double clicks simultaneously a timer (around 100 ms) should be implemented. If after a click, another one is registered within this timer, the double click function should be called. Otherwise, the single click one should be.
