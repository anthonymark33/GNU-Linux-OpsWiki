There are many ways to concatenate string data types.

The most user-friendly approach is using the + operator :

var str = "Hello";
str += " World!";
// a+=b is equal to a=a+b

An other way to concatenate multiple strings is by joinining the elements of an array:

var str = ["Hello"];
str.push(" World!");
str.join("");

You can also use concat function:

var str1 = "Hello ";
var str2 = "world!";
var res = str1.concat(str2);

JavaScript deals with the problem of immutable strings internally when using the + operator, making it performance-friendly in most cases.

Using the array method proves also effective when using IE 6/7.
