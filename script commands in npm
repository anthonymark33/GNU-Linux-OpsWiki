npm supports combining commands when running scripts. It will run the scripts bypassing the line to sh, thus making running scripts just as simple from the command line.

To pipe the result of a script to another use the | character:

"scripts" : {
  "build-js" : "browserify  -t reactify \
      app/js/index.js | uglifyjs -mc > \
      static/bundle.js" 
  }

Supposing browserify, reactify and uglify-js are provided in devDependencies, this script above will pipe the result of bundling the JavaScript files to uglifyjs .

Anding commands is also possible using the && command:

"scripts" : {
  "build":  "npm run build-js && \
        npm run build-less"
}

Using the & character, concurrent scripts can also be run:

 "scripts": {    
    "first": "npm run one & npm run two" 
    "one": "watchify app/js/file.js -t",
    "two": "nodemon index.js""    
  }

If first is run, both one and two scripts will be run concurrently.
