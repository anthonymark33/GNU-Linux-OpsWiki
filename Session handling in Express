Prior to handling sessions in Express 4.0, the express-session middleware must be installed:

$ npm install express-session

Session can be accessed through the request object:

var sess;
app.get('/', function(req,res) {
  sess = req.session;
  // more code here
} // sess initialized as homepage is visited

Creating session variables:

sess.id = "100";
sess.myVar = "myValue";

Destroying sessions:

req.session.destroy(function(err){
});

Keep in mind that the express-session module is very big, providing numerous methods and properties of the session object.
