You can search for commits that were made by a particular author by using the --author option.

This produces a filtered log output containing only the commits made by that author.

For example:

$ git log --pretty=format:"%h: %s" 
  --author=enki 
bc15f3c: Fix scrolling bug
b423c5d: New game format
f75e351: Change insight layout
