To delete a file from your project in git you use git rm.

However, if you only want to remove the file from the index but not the working directory, use instead:

$ git rm --cached myFile
# untrack myFile

You can do the same for a directory:

$ git rm --cached -r myDirectory
# untrack myDirectory
