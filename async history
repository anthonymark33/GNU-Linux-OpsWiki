There are several ways of programming asynchronously in Javascript. Each method was introduced as an improvement over the existing method.

ES5 callbacks

Use a callback function to encapsulate the continuation of the program. Some problems are "callback hell", error handling and no use of return or throw.

ES6 promises

Use promises as a placeholder for a future value, like an order number at a fast-food restaurant. This allows decisions to be made before the value is known.

ES6 generators

Pause and continue a generator function from a yield point. This is designed for synchronous programming but can be hacked into working asynchronously.

ES7 async

In ES7 it will be possible to use the async keyword to create an async function. The await keyword works similarly to yield.
