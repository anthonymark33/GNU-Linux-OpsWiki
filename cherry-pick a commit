Cherry-picking refers to when you merge a commit from one branch to another.

For example:

$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick a456bd7
# merge commit a456bd7 
# with branch master

This is most useful when you are unable to merge the two branches. For example, you might want to fix a security issue present in both branches.
