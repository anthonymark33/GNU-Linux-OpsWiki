jmap - Memory Map: Prints shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given JVM process or a Java core file on the local machine. It can also used with the jsadebugd daemon to query a process or core file on a remote machine.

To print the heap configuration of a running Process:

$ jmap -heap PID

To print the heap histogram for a running Process:

$ jmap -histo PID

To list all loaded shared objects:

$ jmap PID

You can also dump the heap information into a .bin file:

$ jmap -dump:file=myFile.bin PID

If the jmap PID command does not respond because of a hung process, the -F option can be used (on Solaris OS and Linux only) to force the use of the Serviceability Agent.
