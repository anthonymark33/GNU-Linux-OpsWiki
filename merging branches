You can merge branches in git using git merge.

For example, to merge the fix branch into master:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge fix

In most cases this results in a three-way merge, which is where git makes a new commit based on the most recent commits of both fix and master, as well as their most recent shared commit (i.e. common ancestor).

Autocommit can be avoided by using the --no-commit option, which is useful when you want to make additional tweaks to the merge result.

You can then delete the fix branch:

$ git branch -d fix
