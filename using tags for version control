In git you can tag a certain point in history as being important. You can use this to mark a new version.

You can create an annotated tag by:

$ git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"

Annotated tags contain useful information: the current commit checksum, your name and email, the date and the tagging message.

You can also create a lightweight tag which acts just as a pointer to the current commit:

$ git tag v1.0.l

You can add a tag to an older commit by specifying part of its commit checksum, for example:

$ git tag -a v.1.0.0 4682c32
