Responsive web design techniques rely heavily on percentage rules. width is relative to the nearest containing parent element. It is possible to use the width of the viewport instead of the width of the parent element using the vh and vw units.

The vh element is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport.

For example, here is a responsive square:

.square {
    width: 20vh;
    height: 20vh;
}

vmin is equal to the smallest of vh and vw, while vmax is the largest.
