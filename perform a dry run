Some commands in git allow you to have a dry run. The --dry-run option gives a preview of the results of the command.

To check which files -fd will delete:

$ git clean -fd --dry-run
Would remove test.md

To check which files a commit will include (much like git status):

$ git commit --dry-run --short
M  index.html
