The Permission API is a standard way to check the permission status of an API.

You can check the status of a permission using permissions.query(). The status is either granted, denied or prompt (if you need to request the permission from the user).

For example:

// Check for Geolocation API permissions. 
// Pass permission's name into method
// as 'permissionDescriptor' object. 
navigator.permissions
               .query({name:'geolocation'})
  // The Promise resolves to
  // `permissionStatus' object 
  .then(function(permissionStatus) { 
    // print state of geolocation permission
    console.log('geo permission 
        state is ', permissionStatus.state);
  });

You can also create an event handler for permissionStatus.onchange.

Requesting permission from the user still depends on the specific API.

Currently this API is only available in Chrome.
